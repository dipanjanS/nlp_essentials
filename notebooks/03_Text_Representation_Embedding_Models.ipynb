        "\n",
        "We have discussed in the previous sub-unit that Feature Engineering is the secret sauce to creating superior and better performing machine learning models. \n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional (count-based) feature engineering strategies for textual data involve models belonging to a family of models popularly known as the Bag of Words model. This includes term frequencies, TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), N-grams and so on. While they are effective methods for extracting features from text, due to the inherent nature of the model being just a bag of unstructured words, we lose additional information like the semantics, structure, sequence and context around nearby words in each text document. \n",
        "\n",
        "This forms as enough motivation for us to explore more sophisticated models which can capture this information and give us features which are vector representation of words, popularly known as embeddings.\n",

        "Here we will explore the following feature engineering techniques:\n",

        "- GloVe\n",
        "- FastText\n",
        "\n",
        "Predictive methods like Neural Network based language models try to predict words from its neighboring words looking at word sequences in the corpus and in the process it learns distributed representations giving us dense word embeddings. We will be focusing on these predictive methods in this article."

        "The GloVe model stands for Global Vectors which is an unsupervised learning model which can be used to obtain dense word vectors similar to Word2Vec. However the technique is different and training is performed on an aggregated global word-word co-occurrence matrix, giving us a vector space with meaningful sub-structures. This method was invented in Stanford by Pennington et al. and I recommend you to read the original paper on GloVe, _[‘GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation’ by Pennington et al.](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf)_ which is an excellent read to get some perspective on how this model works.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic methodology of the GloVe model is to first create a huge word-context co-occurence matrix consisting of (word, context) pairs such that each element in this matrix represents how often a word occurs with the context (which can be a sequence of words). The idea then is to apply matrix factorization to approximate this matrix as depicted in the following figure.\n",

        "Such that we we aim to reconstruct __WC__ from __WF__ and __FC__ by multiplying them. For this, we typically initialize __WF__ and __FC__ with some random weights and attempt to multiply them to get __WC'__ (an approximation of __WC__) and measure how close it is to __WC__. We do this multiple times using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to minimize the error. Finally, the __Word-Feature matrix (WF)__ gives us the word embeddings for each word where __F__ can be preset to a specific number of dimensions"

        "# The FastText Model\n",
        "\n",
        "The FastText model was first introduced by Facebook in 2016 as an extension and supposedly improvement of the vanilla Word2Vec model. Based on the original paper titled _[‘Enriching Word Vectors with Subword Information’](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04606.pdf)_ by Mikolov et al. which is an excellent read to gain an in-depth understanding of how this model works. Overall, FastText is a framework for learning word representations and also performing robust, fast and accurate text classification. The framework is open-sourced by Facebook on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) and claims to have the following.\n",

        "- Recent state-of-the-art English word vectors.\n",
        "- Word vectors for 157 languages trained on Wikipedia and Crawl.\n",
        "- Models for language identification and various supervised tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Though I haven't implemented this model from scratch, based on the research paper, following is what I learnt about how the model works. In general, predictive models like the Word2Vec model typically considers each word as a distinct entity (e.g. where) and generates a dense embedding for the word. However this poses to be a serious limitation with languages having massive vocabularies and many rare words which may not occur a lot in different corpora. \n",
        "\n",
        "The Word2Vec model typically ignores the morphological structure of each word and considers a word as a single entity. The FastText model ___considers each word as a Bag of Character n-grams___. This is also called as a ___subword model___ in the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "We add special boundary symbols __<__ and __>__ at the beginning and end of words. This enables us to distinguish prefixes and suffixes from other character sequences. We also include the word __w__ itself in the set of its n-grams, to learn a representation for each word (in addition to its character n-grams). \n",
        "\n",
        "Taking the word where and __n=3 (tri-grams)__ as an example, it will be represented by the __character n-grams__: __<wh, whe, her, ere, re>__ and the special sequence __< where >__ representing the whole word. Note that the sequence , corresponding to the word __< her >__ is different from the tri-gram __her__ from the word __where__.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, the paper recommends in extracting all the n-grams for __n ≥ 3__ and __n ≤ 6__. This is a very simple approach, and different sets of n-grams could be considered, for example taking all prefixes and suffixes. We typically associate a vector representation (embedding) to each n-gram for a word. \n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, we can represent a word by the sum of the vector representations of its n-grams or the average of the embedding of these n-grams. Thus, due to this effect of leveraging n-grams from individual words based on their characters, there is a higher chance for rare words to get a good representation since their character based n-grams should occur across other words of the corpus."
